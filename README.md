# Agentic Summariser

**Status**: Idea/Concept Phase

## What is this?

A tool to automatically read through Gmail and Reddit, find common themes, and create action items.

## The Goal

Instead of manually going through hundreds of emails and posts, get a weekly summary like:

```
This week's themes:
1. React 19 updates - mentioned in 12 places
   Action: Read the migration guide
   
2. Client project deadlines - 3 urgent emails
   Action: Reply to Sarah by Friday
```

## How it would work

Three simple parts:
1. **Collector** - pulls emails and Reddit posts
2. **Analyzer** - uses an LLM to find patterns and create tasks  
3. **Researcher** - digs deeper into topics when you ask

## Next steps

- Research Gmail and Reddit APIs
- Test some basic theme extraction with ChatGPT/Claude
- Build a simple prototype

That's it. No code exists yet.
